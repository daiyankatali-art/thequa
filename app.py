    You are an expert evaluator. Analyze each user answer against the correct answer and provide detailed feedback with scoring.

    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: {questions_list}
    USER ANSWERS: {user_answer}

    For each question, provide:
    1. A score out of 10 (10 = perfect match, 0 = completely wrong)
    2. Detailed analysis explaining:
       - What the user got right
       - What the user missed or got wrong
       - How close their answer was to the correct answer
       - Specific suggestions for improvement

    Scoring criteria:
    - 9-10: Excellent - Covers all key points accurately
    - 7-8: Good - Covers most key points with minor gaps
    - 5-6: Fair - Some correct elements but missing important details
    - 3-4: Poor - Few correct elements, major gaps or errors
    - 0-2: Very Poor - Mostly incorrect or completely off-topic

    Return the data in this EXACT JSON format:
    [
        {{
            "question": "Original question text",
            "answer": "Correct answer",
